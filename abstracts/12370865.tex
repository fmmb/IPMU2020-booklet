This paper considers the problem of learning a  generalized credal network (a set of Bayesian networks) from a dataset. It is based on using the BDEu score and computes all the networks with score above a predetermined factor of the optimal one. To avoid the problem of determining the equivalent sample size (ESS), the approach also considers the possibility of an undetermined ESS. Even if the final result is a set of Bayesian networks, the paper also studies the problem of selecting a single network with some alternative procedures. Finally, some preliminary experiments are carried out with three small networks.
