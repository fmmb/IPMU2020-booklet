Double residuated lattices are expansions of residuated lattices with an extra monoidal operator, playing the role of a strong disjunction operation, together with its dual residuum. They were introduced by Or{\l}owska and Radzikowska. In this paper we consider the subclass of double residuated structures that are expansions  of MTL-algebras, that is, prelinear, bounded, commutative and integral residuated lattices. MTL-algebras constitute the algebraic semantics for the MTL logic, the system of mathematical fuzzy logic that is complete w.r.t. the class of residuated lattices on the real unit interval $[0,1]$ induced by left-continuous t-norms. Our aim is to axiomatise the logic whose intended semantics are commutative and integral double residuated structures on $[0, 1]$, that are induced by an arbitrary left-continuous t-norm, an arbitrary right-continuous t-conorm, and their corresponding residual operations.
