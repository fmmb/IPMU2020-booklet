Characterizing the degree of similarity or difference between two sets is a very important topic, since it has many applications in different areas, including image processing or decision making. Several studies have been done about the comparison of fuzzy sets and its extensions, in particular for interval-valued fuzzy sets. However, in most of the cases, the results of the comparison is just a number. In order to avoid this reduction of the information, we have introduced a measure for comparing two interval-valued fuzzy sets such that it is an interval itself, which can be reduced to a number if it is  necessary. Thus,  a richer class of measures is now considered.
