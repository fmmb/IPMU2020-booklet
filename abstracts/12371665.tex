	Relational variants of categories of \v Cech closure or interior $L$-valued operators, categories of $L$-fuzzy pretopological and $L$-fuzzy co-pretopological operators, category of $L$-valued fuzzy relation, categories of upper and lower $F$-transforms and the category of spaces with fuzzy partitions are introduced. The existence of relationships defined by functors among these categories are investigated and a key role of a relational category of spaces with fuzzy partitions is described.
