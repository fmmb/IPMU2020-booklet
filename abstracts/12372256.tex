This paper presents the problem and the solution of ovulation date prediction based on simple data acquired by a woman in home environment. It describes a method of processing collected data as a multivariate time series. The novelty of this algorithm lies in its ability to predict the ovulation date and not only to retrospectively detect it. This is achieved by applying the fuzzy network of comparators (NoC) to compare the menstrual cycle being analyzed with the reference set of historical cycles.
