The article aims to introduce four types of integral transforms for functions whose function values belong to a complete residuated lattice. The integral transforms are defined using so-called qualitative residuum based fuzzy integrals and integral kernels in the form of binary fuzzy relations. We present some of the basic properties of proposed integral transforms including a linearity property that is satisfied under specific conditions for comonotonic functions.
