%We investigate 
%This paper introduces and investigates Depth-bounded Belief functions,
%a logic-based representation of quantified uncertainty. Depth-bounded
%Belief functions  are based on the framework of Depth-bounded Logics
%\cite{DFG13}, which provide a hierarchy of approximations to classical
%logic. Similarly, Depth-bounded Belief functions give rise to a hierarchy
%of increasingly tighter lower and upper bounds over classical measures
%of uncertainty. This has the rather welcome consequence to the
%effect that ``higher logical abilities'' lead to sharper uncertainty quantification.
%In particular, our main results identify the conditions under which
%Dempster-Shafer Belief functions and  probability functions can be represented as a limit of a suitable sequence of Depth-bounded Belief functions.  
% Beyond allowing us to address well-known criticism of the probabilistic representation of uncertainty from a logical angle, such functions provide approximations of classical belief functions and probability.
%In particular, we introduce a hierarchy of Depth-bounded Belief
%functions, which are shown to approximate in the limit any classical
%Belief function.
We introduce measures of uncertainty that are based on {\em Depth-Bounded Logics} and resemble belief functions. We show that our measures can be seen as approximation of classical probability measures over classical logic, and that 
a variant of the PSAT problem for them is solvable in polynomial time.
