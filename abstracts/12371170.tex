In this paper, we introduce two rather effective methods for constructing new families of nullnorms
with a zero element on the basis of the closure operators and interior operators on a
bounded lattice under some additional conditions. Our constructions can be seen as a
generalization of the ones in [REF]. As a by-product, two types of idempotent nullnorms
on bounded lattices are obtained. Several interesting examples are included to get a better
understanding of the structure of new families of nullnorms.
