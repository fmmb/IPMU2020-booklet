	We present new results in the calculus for fuzzy-valued functions of a
	single real variable. We adopt extensively the midpoint-radius
	representation of intervals in the real half-plane and show its usefulness
	in fuzzy calculus. Concepts related to convergence and limits, continuity,
	level-wise gH-differentiability of first and second orders have nice and useful midpoint expressions.
	Using mid-point representation of fuzzy-valued functions, partial orders and properties of monotonicity and convexity are discussed and analysed in detail.  Periodicity is easy to represent and identify. Graphical examples and pictures accompany the presentation.
