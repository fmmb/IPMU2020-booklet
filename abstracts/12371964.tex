Convexity is a very important property in many areas and the studies of this property are frequent. In this paper, we have extended the notion of convexity for interval-valued fuzzy sets based on different order between intervals. The considered orders are related and their behavior analyzed. In particular, we study the preservation of the convexity under intersections, where again the chosen order is essential. After this study, we can conclude the appropriate behavior of the admissible orders for this purpose.
