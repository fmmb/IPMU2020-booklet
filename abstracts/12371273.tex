In a global competitive environment, companies' ability to develop products and respond to customer demands is crucial to their success. Quality Function Deployment is an approach that companies use to meet customer needs and expectations in the product design process. It provides competitive advantage to the firm by shortening the development period of products that meet customer expectations. The purpose of this research is to explore the feasibility of the QFD approach in the design of an e-commerce web site. In this context, the QFD application has been implemented to meet customer expectations and increase competitive power of the site to be designed. Bipolar fuzzy numbers are used to express customers' decisions. This research contributes to the literature with a new QFD approach with bipolar fuzzy numbers and practice by expanding QFD's application field in software sector.
