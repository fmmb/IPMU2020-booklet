The process of outer approximating a coherent lower probability by a more tractable model with additional properties, such as 2- or completely monotone capacities, may not have a unique solution. In this paper, we investigate whether a number of approaches may help in eliciting a unique outer approximation: minimising a number of distances with respect to the initial model, or maximising the specificity of the outer approximation. We apply these to 2- and completely monotone approximating lower probabilities, and also to possibility measures.
%The abstract should briefly summarize the contents of the paper in 150--250 words.
