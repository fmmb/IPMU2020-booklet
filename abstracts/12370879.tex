We consider a set of comparative probability judgements over a finite possibility space and study the structure of the set of probability measures that are compatible with them.
We relate the existence of some compatible probability measure to Walley's behavioural theory of imprecise probabilities, and introduce a graphical representation that allows us to bound, and in some cases determine, the extreme points of the set of compatible measures.
In doing this, we generalise some earlier work by Miranda and Destercke on elementary comparisons.
