Decision making processes are often based on 
(pairwise) preference relations.
An important property of preference relations
is transitivity.
Many types of transitivity have been proposed in the
literature, such as
max--min and max--max transitivity,
restricted max--min and max--max transitivity,
additive and multiplicative transitivity, or
{\L}ukasiewicz transitivity.
This paper focuses on weak transitivity.
Weak transitivity has been defined 
for additive preference relations.
We extend this definition to multiplicative preference 
relations and further introduce a generalized version called
generalized weak transitivity.
We show that
for reciprocal additive and multiplicative preference relations
weak transitivity is equivalent to
generalized weak transitivity,
and we also illustrate 
generalized weak transitivity
for preference relations that are neither additive nor multiplicative.
Finally,
we show how
a total order (ranking of the options) can
be constructed for any
generalized weak transitive preference relation.
