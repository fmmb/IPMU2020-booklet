Zadeh's extension is a powerful principle in fuzzy set theory which allows to extend a real-valued continuous map to a map having fuzzy sets as its arguments. In our previous work we introduced an algorithm which can compute Zadeh’s extension of given continuous piecewise linear functions and then to simulate fuzzy dynamical systems given by them. The purpose of this work is to present results which generalize our previous approach to a more complex class of maps. For that purpose we present an adaptation on optimization algorithm called particle swarm optimization and demonstrate its use for simulation of fuzzy dynamical systems.
