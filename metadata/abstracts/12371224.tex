In this contribution the concept how to solve the problem of comparability in the interval-valued fuzzy setting and its application in medical diagnosis is presented. Especially, we consider comparability of interval-valued fuzzy sets cardinality, where order of its elements is most important.  We propose an algorithm for comparing interval-valued fuzzy cardinal numbers (IVFCNs) and we evaluate it in a medical diagnosis decision support system.
