
Differential operators play an important role in the mathematical modeling of dynamic processes and the analysis of various structures. However, there are certain limitations in their use. To remove them, nonlocal differential operators have been proposed. In this work, we focus on nonlocal Laplace operator, which has become increasingly useful in image processing. We introduce the representation of 

F-transform based Laplace operator in a space with a fuzzy partition. Many useful properties of this operator are proposed and their proofs are also included.
