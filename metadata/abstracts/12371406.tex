Tourism is a relevant economic activity that provides important resources (income, employment,...) to countries. When a tourist visits a country or city, he/she wants to know their points of interest. To do this, he/she must select some of the places according to his/her preferences and design routes to visit them. This problem can be adequately modeled as a Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (TOPTW). In this paper we propose a fuzzy GRASP and a multi-agent simulation model to solve the TOPTW. Our proposal incorporates two criteria to build the restricted candidate list. The computational results obtained show the validity of the proposal.
