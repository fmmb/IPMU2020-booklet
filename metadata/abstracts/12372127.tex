Using a category dual to finite $\mathbb{BL}$-algebras and their homomorphisms,
in this paper
we characterise the structure of the automorphism group of any given finite $\mathbb{BL}$-algebra.
Further, we specialise
our result to the case of the variety generated by the $k$-element $\mathbb{MV}$-algebra, for each $k > 1$.
