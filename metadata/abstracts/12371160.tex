 This paper deals with interaction  between criteria in a
general Choquet integral model. When the preference of the Decision
Maker (DM) contains no indifference, we first give a necessary and
sufficient condition for them to be representable by a Choquet
integral model. Using this condition, we show that it is always
possible to choose from the numerical representations, one
relatively for which all the Shapley interaction indices are strictly
positive. We illustrate our results with an example.
