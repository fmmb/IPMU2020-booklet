We introduce a game for (extended) G\"odel logic where the players'
interaction stepwise reduces claims about the relative order 
of truth degrees of complex formulas to atomic truth comparison claims.
Using the concept of disjunctive game states this semantic game is
lifted to a provability game, where winning strategies correspond to
proofs in a sequents-of-relations calculus.
