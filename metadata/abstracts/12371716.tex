		The goal is to introduce and study the measure of quality of approximation of a given fuzzy set by its lattice-valued $F$-transform. Further, we show that this measure is connected with an Alexandroff $LM$-fuzzy topological (co-topological) spaces. Finally, we discuss the categorical relationship between the defined structures.
