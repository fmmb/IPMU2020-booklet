
We introduce twelve operators called \emph{fuzzy quantifier-based operators}. They are proposed as a new tool to help to deepen the analysis of data in fuzzy formal concept analysis. 
 Moreover, we employ them to construct a graded extension of Aristotle's square, namely the \emph{graded decagon of opposition}.
