We present an application of linguistic summaries in the agro-food domain. We focus on the relevance aspect. Using the interviews we  determine which linguistic summaries are useful and appropriate for target users (farmers). The user evaluation with a TAM survey indicates that linguistic summaries allow farmers to understand quickly the past performance of their pig barns.
