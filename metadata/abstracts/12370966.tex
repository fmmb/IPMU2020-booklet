We consider objects associated with a fuzzy set-based
representation. By using a classic method of measurement
theory, we characterize dissimilarity relations agreeing with a particular class of fuzzy dissimilarity
measures. Dissimilarity measures in the considered class are those only depending on the attribute-wise distance of fuzzy description profiles. In particular, we analyze the subclass of weighted Manhattan dissimilarity measures.
