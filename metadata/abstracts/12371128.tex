
We present a method of generalization of the Lov\'asz extension formula combining two known approaches - the first of them based on the replacement of the product operator by some suitable binary function $F$ and the second one based on the replacement of the minimum operator by a suitable aggregation function $A$. We propose generalization by simultaneous replacement of both product and minimum operators and investigate pairs $(F,A)$ yielding an aggregation function for all capacities.
