  In this paper, a new approach to compare measures of entropy in the setting of the
  intuitionistic fuzzy sets introduced by Ata\-nas\-sov.  A polar representation is
  introduced to represent such bipolar information and it is used to study the three main
  intuitionistic fuzzy sets entropies of the literature. A theoretical comparison and some
  experimental results highlight the interest of such a representation to gain knowledge
  on these entropies.
