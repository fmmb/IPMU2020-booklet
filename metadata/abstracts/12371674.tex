This work presents an application of interactive fuzzy fractional differential equation, with Caputo derivative, to an HIV model for seropositive individuals under antiretroviral treatment. The initial condition of the model is given by a fuzzy number and the differentiability is given by a fuzzy interactive derivative. A discussion about the model considering these notions are presented. Finally, a numerical solution to the problem is provided, in order to illustrate the results.
