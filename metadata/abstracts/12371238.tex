In the paper  Jin et al. [2019] the authors introduced a generalized phi-transformation of aggregation functions. This is a kind of two-step aggregation. This transformation was further developed in  Jin et al. [2020] into a Generalized-Convex-Sum-Transformation. A special case of the proposed  Generalized-Convex-Sum-Transformation is the well-known *-product, also known as the Darsow product of copulas. This approach covers also the discrete Choquet integral. In this paper we  study the monotone systems of functions, particularly the case when functions in these systems are just two-valued.
