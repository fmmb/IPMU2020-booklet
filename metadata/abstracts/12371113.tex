 Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy set theory is based on the lattice $L^*$ of intuitionistic values and their aggregation. There are lots of
works dealing with this topic, but mostly considering some particular cases. In this contribution, we offer  a rather general view on aggregation of intuitionistic values with transparent proofs of several properties which significantly shorten the related proofs for particular cases known from the literature.
