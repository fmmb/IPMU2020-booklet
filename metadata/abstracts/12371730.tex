		In this paper, we apply special fuzzy techniques to analyze the gold price historical data. The main tools are the higher degree fuzzy transform and specific methods of fuzzy natural logic. First, we show how to apply the former for the estimation of the trend-cycle. Then, we provide methodologies for identifying monotonous periods in the trend-cycle and describe them by sentences in natural language.
