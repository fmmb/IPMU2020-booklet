In this study, we compare the behavior of classic Hurwicz criterion with three more recent criteria $\tau$-anchor, $R^*$ and $R_*$. 
This evaluation is realized on linear optimization problems with uncertain costs coefficients taking into account the risk aversion of the decision maker. The uncertainty is represented by a scenario set.
