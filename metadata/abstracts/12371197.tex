In the context of the representation of a preference information by a 2-additive Choquet integral, we introduce  the necessary and possible importance relations allowing to compare the Shapley values of two criteria. We present some sufficient conditions, using a set of binary alternatives, to get a necessary importance relation among two criteria.
