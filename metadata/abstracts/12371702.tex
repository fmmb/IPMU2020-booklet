This paper investigates the essential connections among several categories with a weaker structure than that of $L$-fuzzifying topology, namely category of $L$-fuzzifying approximation spaces based on reflexive $L$-fuzzy relations, category of $L$-fuzzifying pretopological spaces and category of $L$-fuzzifying interior (closure) spaces. The interrelations among these structures are established in categorical setup.
