Our application concerns the fusion of classifiers for the recognition of trees from their leaves, in the framework of belief functions theory. In order to improve the rate of good classification it is necessary to correct Bayesian mass functions. This correction will be done from the meta-knowledge which is estimated from the confusion matrix. The corrected mass functions considerably improve the recognition rate based on the decisions provided by the classifiers.
