Applying interval-valued data and methods, researchers have made solid accomplishments in  information processing and  uncertainty management. Although interval-valued statistics and probability are available for interval-valued data, current inferential decision making schemes rely on point-valued statistic and probabilistic measures mostly.  To enable direct applications of these point-valued schemes on interval-valued datasets, we present point-valued variational statistics, probability, and entropy for interval-valued datasets.  Related algorithms are reported with illustrative examples.
