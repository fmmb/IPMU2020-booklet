The construction of Galois connections between unbalanced structures has received considerable attention in the recent years. 
In a nutshell, the problem is to find a right adjoint of a mapping defined between sets with unbalanced structure; in this paper we survey recent results obtained in this framework, focusing specially on    the fuzzy structures that have been considered so far in this context:
   fuzzy preposets, fuzzy preordered structures,      and fuzzy T-digraphs.
