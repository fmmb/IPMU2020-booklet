  In collaboration with the Civil Hospitals of Lyon, we aim
to develop a "transparent" classification system for medical purposes.
To do so, we need clear definitions and operational criteria to determine
what is a "transparent" classification system in our context.
However, the term "transparency" is often left undefined
in the literature, and there is a lack of operational criteria
allowing to check whether a given algorithm deserves to be called
"transparent" or not.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a definition of "transparency"
for classification systems in medical contexts.
We also propose several operational criteria to evaluate
whether a classification system can be considered 
"transparent".
We apply these operational criteria to evaluate the 
"transparency" of several well-known classification systems.
