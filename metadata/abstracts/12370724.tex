This presentation introduces the theory leading to solution methods for
differential algebraic equations (DAEs) under interval uncertainty in which
the uncertainty is in the initial conditions of the differential equation
and/or the entries of the coefficients of the differential equation and
algebraic restrictions. \ While we restrict these uncertainties to
be\textit{\ intervals,}other types of uncertains like generalized uncetainties
such as fuzzy intervals are done in a similar manner albeit leading to more
complex analyses. \ Linear constant coefficient DAEs and then\ interval linear
constant coefficient problems will illustrate both the theoretically
challenges and solution approaches. \ The way the interval uncertainty is
handled is novel and serves as a basis for more general uncertainty analysis.
