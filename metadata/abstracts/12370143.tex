Nowadays, the rise of the interconnected computer networks and the increase of processed data have led to producing distributed systems. These systems usually separate multiple tasks into other simpler with the goal of maintaining efficiency. This paradigm has been observed for a long time in different animal organisations as insect colonies and fish shoals. For this reason, distributed systems that emulate the biological rules that govern their collective behaviour have been developed. \gls{MAS} have shown their ability to address this issue. This paper proposes \gls{ACA-SL}. It is a bio-inspired model based on ant colony structures. It makes use of \gls{MAS} to distribute tasks and \gls{SL} to produce \gls{DSS} according to the combination of individual opinions. A system implementation based on the proposed architecture has been generated to illustrate the viability of the proposal. The proposed architecture is intended to be the starting point for developing systems that solve a variety of problems.
