This study compares three fuzzy based model approaches for solving a realistic extension of the Time Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem. First, the triple Fuzzy (3FTD TSP) model, where the uncertain costs between the nodes depend on time are expressed by fuzzy sets. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy (IFTD TSP) approach, where including hesitation was suitable for quantifying the jam regions and the bimodal rush hour periods during the day. Third, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets model, that calculates the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic average (IIFWAA) of the edges' confirmability degrees and non-confirmability degrees, was contributing in minimizing the information loss in cost (delay) calculation between nodes.
